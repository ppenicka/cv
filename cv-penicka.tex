\cvsect{About Me}

\begin{minipage}[t]{1\textwidth}
  \vspace{-\baselineskip}

  {Frontend engineer specialised in JavaScript technologies, most notably Vue.js, Vuex, React, Redux and TypeScript. Before switching to software engineering, I gained 12+ years of experience in the tech industry as a technical writer and later a program manager. Then I realised that instead of documenting software or coordinating teams, engineering itself is what brings me the most satisfaction. Currently in my second engineering job and looking for new challenges.}\\
