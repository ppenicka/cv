\cvsect{About Me}

\begin{minipage}[t]{1\textwidth}
  \vspace{-\baselineskip}

  {Senior Frontend Engineer specializing in JavaScript technologies, most notably Vue.js, Nuxt.js, TypeScript and React. Before switching to software engineering, I gained 12+ years of experience in the tech industry as a Program Manager and a Technical Writer. This makes me stand out among other engineers due to exceptional communication, planning and organizational skills. If you're looking for an engineer who not only writes great code, but is also a pleasure to work with for colleagues in non-technical roles, I'm likely the right fit.}\\
